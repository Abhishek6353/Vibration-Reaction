# Vibration Reaction

**Vibration Reaction** is a premium, high-precision iOS application built with SwiftUI designed to measure and test your reaction reflexes using tactile haptic feedback and dynamic visual cues.

## 🚀 Features

- **Haptic-First Testing**: Focuses on sensation-based reaction rather than just visual changes.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Immersive UI with animated gradients and pulsing backgrounds synchronized with haptics.
- **Performance Tiers**: Automatically categorizes your results into **Elite**, **Great**, **Average**, or **Slow**.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Dark mode aesthetic with glassmorphism elements and premium typography.
- **Precision Timing**: Accurate measurement of reaction time in milliseconds.

## 📱 How It Works

1. **Prepare**: Tap "BEGIN TEST" and wait.
2. **Focus**: The device will pulse with heavy vibration for a random duration, accompanied by a red pulsing glow.
3. **React**: As soon as the vibration stops and the screen turns cyan, tap as quickly as you can!
4. **Analyze**: View your reaction time and see which reflex tier you fall into.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift 5.10+
- **Platform**: iOS 16.0+
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Haptics**: CoreHaptics / UIImpactFeedbackGenerator

## 🛠 Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Vibration ReactionDemo.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. Ensure you have a physical device connected (Haptics are best experienced on hardware).
4. Build and Run.
